# ChessAnalysis Installation Guide

## Overview

ChessAnalysis is a Python library designed for analyzing chess games. It provides various functions to analyze game statistics, including errors per move, average time per move, records by openings, and more. This guide will help you install the library and its dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before installing ChessAnalysis, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python 3.6 or later**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or a newer version installed on your system.
2. **pip**: The Python package installer should be available.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the ChessAnalysis repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tomerkeinan/ChessAnalysis.git
cd ChessAnalysis
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Create the Distribution Package

Create a source distribution package for ChessAnalysis:

```sh
python3 setup.py sdist
```

This will generate a `.tar.gz` file in the `dist` directory.

### 4. Install the Package

Install the ChessAnalysis package using `pip`:

```sh
pip install dist/ChessAnalysis-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

### 5. Verify the Installation

To ensure the library is installed correctly, open a Python interpreter and try importing the main classes:

```sh
python
```

```python
from ChessAnalysis import ChessAnalysis, SingleGame
```

If no errors occur, the installation is successful.

## Including Opening Book Data

ChessAnalysis requires opening book data stored in `.tsv` files located in the `OpeningBook` directory. The setup script is configured to include these files.

The `OpeningBook` directory should contain all necessary `.tsv` files.

```sh
pip uninstall ChessAnalysis
```
